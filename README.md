**Transportation System Simulator**

I created a simulator that takes a map of an 
underground transportation system as well 
as a city’s population as parameters. 

This simulator would estimate the flow of people through the system, 
determine the overall tunnel mileage and number of vehicles needed to 
efficiently service this system. 

Plugging in different sizes of vehicles and tunnels into the simulator 
allows me to compare a metro system to a system of autonomous cars in tunnels.
